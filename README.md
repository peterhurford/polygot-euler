## Polygot Euler

Go through [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net), attempt to solve each problem efficiently in different programming languages.  Some of these languages I work in professionally (e.g., Ruby, R), others I know a bit from past exeriences (e.g., Coffeescript, JavaScript, PHP, Python, C, Shell), and others I am learning for the very first time here (e.g., K, Go, Haskell, Scala).
